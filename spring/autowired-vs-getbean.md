# Autowired vs getBean

By default, a Spring context will pay no attention to_@Autowired_annotations. In order to process them, the context needs to have a_AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor_bean registered in the context.

```
<context:annotation-config/>
```

registers one of these for you \(along with a few others\), so you do need it \(unless you register_AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor_yourself, which is perfectly valid\).

If you don't like having_@Autowired_in your code, then you can explicitly inject properties in the XML using , which just moves the clutter from one place to another.

If your context is extremely simple, then you can use implicit autowiring, as described[here](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-autowire). Essentially, this tells Spring to autowire automatically by property name or type. This required very little configuration, but it very quickly gets out of control - it's automatic nature means it's hard to control, and gives you very little flexibility.

In general_@Autowired_really is the best option.

With application context, you are injecting the bean by yourself.

Annotation wiring isnâ€™t turned on in the Spring container by default. So, before you can use annotation-based autowiring, you'll need to enable it in your Spring configuration. The simplest way to do that is with the

```
<context:annotation-config>
  <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
  http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.0.xsd">
<context:annotation-config />
...
</beans>
```

Hope this helps.
